/**
 * Sample program to use NIVision to find rectangles in the scene that are illuminated
 * by a red ring light (similar to the model from FIRSTChoice). The camera sensitivity
 * is set very low so as to only show light sources and remove any distracting parts
 * of the image.
 * 
 * The CriteriaCollection is the set of criteria that is used to filter the set of
 * rectangles that are detected. In this example we're looking for rectangles with
 * a minimum width of 30 pixels and maximum of 400 pixels. Similar for height (see
 * the addCriteria() methods below.
 * 
 * The algorithm first does a color threshold operation that only takes objects in the
 * scene that have a significant red color component. Then removes small objects that
 * might be caused by red reflection scattered from other parts of the scene. Then
 * a convex hull operation fills all the rectangle outlines (even the partially occluded
 * ones). Finally a particle filter looks for all the shapes that meet the requirements
 * specified in the criteria collection.
 *
 * Look in the VisionImages directory inside the project that is created for the sample
 * images as well as the NI Vision Assistant file that contains the vision command
 * chain (open it with the Vision Assistant)
